# Contributing

Woohoo!!! Welcome to Hat's Protocol ðŸ§¢ ðŸŽ© ðŸ‘’ !!!

Thank you for coming to contribute to the project. We want this to be an open source protocol, which means we only run when people, like you, contribute time and effort.

Now lets get you a hat and get to work!

While there are many ways to contribute to Hats Protocol, we use a similar process on helping guide contributors on how to contribute.

1. A good first place to start is the [Issues Board](https://github.com/Hats-Protocol/hats-protocol/issues). Here you'll find a list of all the issues or ideas we're thinking about. Look for the tag `good first issue` if you're not sure where to start.
2. Once you've found a good issue, engage in a discussion on the issue board. This allows you to understand where the teams head is at and how this issue fits into the full picture.
3. After you're confident you understand the problem, fork the repo and start working on the issue. Once it's finished, make a PR to our repo with your contribution. [**Please use these guidelines when forking and making a PR.**](https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork). Please also link your PR to the appropriate issue.

After this, the team will be able to discuss the change and eventually merge!

## Issues

If you encounter a bug or you have an idea, please submit them to our issue board! This allows anyone in the community to engage in working on the bug and/or idea.

We've provided several Issue Templates for you to use.

## Pull Requests

Pull Requests are used to propose changes to the existing Hats Protocol Repo. We ask that you follow the Github Guidlines outlines [here](https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork)!

## Team Communications

Besides this Github Repo, we have a telegram group that we use as our main communication hub. [Come join](https://t.me/+NdM-1NnPnS4xNWIx) to engage in more liquid discussion on the protocol.
