## What's a hat?
Hats Protocol provides a useful and flexible primitive for DAO-native roles and credentials that supports revocable delegation of authority and responsibility.

Built for automation, hats are an enabling infrastructure that give DAOs granular control over what a hat can do on behalf of the DAO and who (or what) can wear it. Tied to an address, hats can be worn by EOAs (contributors), contracts, multisigs, and even other DAOs.

You can think of a hat as an on-chain "job-in-a-box". Each hat is encoded with parameters that allow its wearer to take certain actions on behalf of your DAO or organization. These parameters - such as voting weight, accountability, compensation - are transparent on-chain and hats can be permissionlessly assigned in accordance with the rules defined by the DAO.


Another way to think about a hat is as a role-bound token that is governed by the DAO, which defines the specific scope of authority a hat wearer can take. For example, a hat can be programmed to give its wearer authority to be a signer on a multisig, an admin on the DAO's Github repo, lead a working group, access the DAO's Twitter acount, or all the above. 

Hats are represented on-chain by non-transferable ERC1155 tokens. An address with a balance of a given Hat token "wears" that hat, granting them the responsibilities and authorities that have been assigned to the Hat by the DAO.

## About this guide
This self-service guide shows you how to _mint a tophat_, _create a hat_, _mint a hat_, and _view a hat_ using a block explorer. It provides a basic introduction to and implementation of the _eligibility and toggle_ modules, as well as how to _token gating_ using hat ids. Finally, it describes hat trees and how the can be linked ("grafted") onto other trees.

The guide is based on Hats Protocol v1-beta.1. Network deployments and contract addresses are included in the Setup section below.

# Quick guides

## Step 2: Select ‚ÄúWrite Contract‚Äù in Contract section and connect wallet


> Hats is currently in beta and should be used at your own risk. We take security seriously and our contracts have been thoroughly tested but are pending audit and bugs may still exist.


  ![Connect wallet](./assets/connectWallet.gif)

You are now ready to interact with the Hats contract.

## Step 3: Proceed to your desired action
- [Mint a Top Hat](#mint-a-tophat)
- [Create a hat](#create-a-hat)
- [Mint a hat](#mint-a-hat)


# Mint a Top Hat  
Minting a Top Hat creates the root of a new Hats tree. Hats trees can be very large, very small, or even just a single hat ‚Äî but they all start with a Top Hat. 

Top Hats have special characteristics that distinguish them from other hat types:
- They are their own admin
- They are always immutable except they can change their own details and image fields*
- They can be linked*
- They can transfer themselves

*_These characteristics are new in v1_


You can mint a Top Hat with the `mintTopHat` function, which creates and mints a hat that is its own admin*, i.e. a `topHat`.


_*Note: New functionality is coming soon that will enable Top Hats and their associated trees to be linked and unlinked to other existing Hats trees, by changing the admin of a Top Hat._

## Step 3: Click ‚ÄúView your transaction‚Äù and save log information
Once the transaction executes click ‚ÄúView your transaction‚Äù, which will take you to a [screen like this](https://gnosisscan.io/tx/0xdb6ce23a6a118f314f10835d999a74e9d2799a899673e4dfdbe16a1a00058b43#eventlog).

  ![Mint Top Hat transaction page](./assets/mintTopHatTx.png)


Be sure to bookmark this page and/or make sure you have an easy way to access it.

The `id` in the Data section is the Hat id that you will use as an input for the `admin` parameter when you create your next hat in the Hats tree.

**Congratulations! You‚Äôve created a Top Hat and the start of a new Hats tree.** üé©

<details>
  <summary>Learn more about what your hat, its <code>id</code>, and the addressable hat scheme</code></summary>

  `id` is the unique identifier for a given hat. You can find it on the in the Logs section of the hat's Transaction page: 

  ![Get hat id](./assets/getHatID.gif)

  The addressable hat scheme tells you key information about a hat in hexidecimal format.

  For example, instead of a hat id looking like this under base 10: <code>26960769438260605603848134863118277618512635038780455604427388092416</code>

  ...under hexidecimal it would look like this: <code>0x0000000100020003000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000</code>

  In this second version, you can see that this hat is...
  - a level 2 hat
  - is in the first hat tree (top hat id = 1)
  - is the third hat created at level 2 within this tree
  - admin'd by the second hat created at level 1 within this tree

  We can also prettify this even further by separating hat levels with periods, a la IP addresses:

  <code>0x00000001.0002.0003.0000.0000.0000.0000.0000.0000.0000.0000.0000.0000.0000.0000</code>
</details>




# Create a hat
Creating a hat generates a new hat to which you can attach specific responsibilities, eligibility criteria for who can wear the hat, toggle criteria to determine when the hat should be active or deactivated, a unique image, and specific authorities or permissions (by plugging in the hat‚Äôs ID into token gates).

You can create a hat using the `createHat` function. Note that the account/address you use to create the hat must be wearing the `admin` hat (or one of _its_ admin hats).

# Mint a hat

Minting a hat causes a hat to be ‚Äúworn‚Äù by a specific address. As a result, minting a hat gives an address the associated responsibilities and authorities associated with the Hat ‚Äî as long as that address is eligible to wear the hat based on the hat‚Äôs eligibility module, and as long as that hat is active as determined by the hat‚Äôs toggle module. Multiple addresses can wear a given hat, up to the max supply of that hat.

Think about a hat like a "job-in-a-box". Each hat has properties that give its wearer the ability to take certain actions under specified conditions. Adding responsibilities and authorities to a hat is something that happens between `createHat` and `mintHat` (and possibly after as well).

You can mint a hat with the `mintHat` function, which mints the hat as an ERC1155 token to a recipient, who then "wears" the hat. Like with creating a hat, the account/address you use to mint a hat must be wearing the hat‚Äôs admin hat (or one of _its_ admin hats).

# View hat information
The `viewHat` read function allows to quickly see information about a hat, without the need to connect you wallet to the block explorer.

## tl;dr
<details>

  <summary>3-second tutorial to view information about a hat</summary>

  ![View a hat](./assets/viewHat.gif)

</details>

## Step 1: Get `id` for hat 
You can find the hat `id` on in the Log section of the hat's Transaction page.

  ![Get hat id](./assets/getHatID.gif)

Copy this `id`.
<details>
  <summary><code>dec</code> vs <code>hex</code> - what's the difference?</summary>
   Both </code>dec</code> and <code>hex</code> formats represent the same hat <code>id</code>.
   <code>Dec</code> is the base 10 format of the hat id and <code>hex</code> is the hexidecimal format.
   <br></br>
   It is recommended for front ends to instead convert hat ids to hexidecimal, revealing the values of the bytes ‚Äî and therefore the hat levels ‚Äî directly.
  <br></br>
   For example, instead of a hat id looking like this under base 10: <code>26960769438260605603848134863118277618512635038780455604427388092416</code>

  ...under hexidecimal it would look like this: <code>0x0000000100020003000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000</code>

  In this second version, you can see that this hat is...
  - a level 2 hat
  - is in the first hat tree (top hat id = 1)
  - is the third hat created at level 2 within this tree
  - admin'd by the second hat created at level 1 within this tree

  We can also prettify this even further by separating hat levels with periods, a la IP addresses:

  <code>0x00000001.0002.0003.0000.0000.0000.0000.0000.0000.0000.0000.0000.0000.0000.0000</code>

</details>  

## Step 2: Navigate to the `Read Contract` page of the hats contract page on the block explorer

  ![Read contract](./assets/readContract.png)

## Step 3: Paste `id` in the `viewHat` function on the `Read Contract` page

# Eligibility and Toggle
Eligibility and toggle are dynamic and extensible modules that have the authority to rule on a hat wearer‚Äôs eligibility and standing (eligibility module) and switch the status of a hat (toggle module).

The eligibility and toggle design space is huge. Future guides will dive deeper and explore more complex implementations of eligibility and toggle logic. This guide focuses on a simple implementation: setting eligibility and toggle as an address that determines eligibility and toggle for a given hat. This involves two contracts: `changeHatEligibility` and `changeHatToggle`.

By default, we recommend setting the eligibility and toggle addresses to the DAO's address (or the address wearing the Top Hat), so that the DAO retains the power to revoke hats and turn them off by vote, until more structure is put in place." might also be good to mention this when creating the hat in the first place.

# Token Gating
Hats allows you to set up token gates using hat IDs. The means can receive certain privileges for interacting with off-chain applications. Examples of token gates you can set up include Discord Admin, Telegram channel access, Gitub, Clarity editing access, and more.

Platforms like [Collab.Land](https://www.collab.land/) and [Guild](https://guild.xyz/) make it easy for you to set up token gating using hat IDs.


# Example: token gate Telegram access
![Token Gate Telegram](./assets/tokenGate_telegram.gif)



If you‚Äôve never used Guild, check out their documentation [here](https://docs.guild.xyz/guild/guides/readme).

## Step 1: Create a new Telegram group or use your existing one
You can follow [these instructions](https://docs.guild.xyz/guild/guides/readme) to do so.

## Step 2: Get the contract address and hat id
On the `mintHat` transaction page, click ‚ÄúView NFT‚Äù:

  ![View NFT transaction page](./assets/tokenGate_viewNFT.png)

Now copy the Contract Address and Token ID (hat id).

_NOTE: If you're unsure where to find the transaction page, see [here](https://gnosisscan.io/nft/0x6b49b86d21abc1d60611bd85c843a9766b5493db/269704778963174955133368068897879977168690339320806273922290413469696) for an example._

## Step 3: Enter the contract address, hat id, and Telegram group id into Guild

_NOTE: If you‚Äôre unsure where your Telegram Group ID is, follow [these instructions](https://docs.guild.xyz/guild/guides/readme)._

## Step 4: Summon and sign the transaction
**Congrats! You‚Äôve successfully token gated Telegram channel access using hat id!**

# Hat Tree linking
As of v1-beta.1 you can link, or "graft", trees to one another. 

This powerful feature lets you attach the Top Hat from one to another Hat Tree. Some example use cases include:
- On-chain DAO mergers (i.e. one DAO joining another DAO)
- subDAO experimentation (e.g. let a subDAO try out new hats features with different authorities and responsibilities, before merging into the main DAO)
- "Refactor" your DAO (e.g. fork your DAO to try different hats configurations before merging with the main DAO)

At a high level the process looks like this:
Two separate Hat Trees exist, each with their own respective Top Hats

<img src=./assets/hatTreeLinking1.png  width="600" height="350">

Hat Tree 2 requests a link to a specific hat in Hat Tree 1. Effectively it asks, _"hat, ser - will you be my admin hat?"_

<img src=./assets/hatTreeLinking2.png  width="600" height="350">

If approved, Hat Tree 2 links, or "grafts", to Hat Tree 1. The approving hat becomes the admin hat the Top Hat from Hat Tree 2.

<img src=./assets/hatTreeLinking3.png  width="600" height="400">
